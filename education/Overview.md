The transition to Solana brought about several significant improvements to the Helium network's structure and functionalities. Here's a quick overview of the key changes:

1. Blockchain Foundation:
Helium has migrated to the Solana blockchain, ensuring a more scalable and resilient network infrastructure.
Faster transaction speeds, improved reliability, and enhanced security are notable benefits.

2. Network Performance:
Solana's architecture has optimized the performance of the Helium network, offering a smoother and more efficient experience.

3. Composability:
Helium can now take full advantage of the composability of the Solana ecosystem, fostering collaboration with other Solana projects.

Solana-Specific Features:
Operating on Solana introduces exciting features and capabilities to the Helium network. Here's a glimpse of what you can expect:

1. Clockwork Automation:
Helium utilizes Clockwork, an open-source automation engine on Solana, to schedule transactions and automate smart contracts seamlessly.

2. Helius Development Optimization:
Helium benefits from Helius, a Solana development optimization service, for APIs, monitoring, and overall development efficiency.

3. Jupiter Liquidity Aggregator:
The integration with Jupiter allows Helium users to access a wide range of tokens and facilitates route discovery for token swaps.

4. Pyth Oracles Integration:
Helium leverages Pyth Oracles on Solana to consume real-world data for various use cases, enhancing reliability and accuracy.

5. Switchboard Oracle Network:
Switchboard, a decentralized oracle network on Solana, is utilized by Helium to measure and incorporate device statistics into on-chain reward calculations.

Updated Tokenomics:
With the migration to Solana, there have been adjustments to the tokenomics, rewards, and incentives within the Helium network:

1. Token Migration:
Helium tokens (HNT) have migrated to the Solana blockchain, ensuring a seamless transition for users.

2. New Incentive Structures:
Explore updated reward structures and incentives designed to encourage active participation in the Helium ecosystem.

3. Enhanced Security Measures:
Learn about the enhanced security measures implemented on Solana, contributing to a more secure and trustworthy Helium network.

Migration FAQs:
To address common queries related to the migration, here's a compilation of frequently asked questions:

Q: Why did Helium migrate to Solana?
A: The migration to Solana was initiated to achieve faster transaction speeds, scalability, and improved network reliability.

Q: Do I need to take any action after the migration?
A: No, as a user, once your Hotspot is deployed and onboarded to the Helium blockchain on Solana, no further action is required to earn rewards.

Q: How does the migration impact token balances?
A: Token balances are frozen during the migration period but will be accessible once the new Solana-based infrastructure is online.

Q: Are there any changes in how I earn rewards on Helium?
A: Yes, explore the updated reward distribution mechanisms and incentive structures on the Helium network post-migration.
