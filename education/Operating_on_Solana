Introduction:
The Helium network, a pioneer in decentralized wireless infrastructure, has embarked on a transformative journey by migrating to the Solana blockchain. This shift represents a significant leap forward in terms of scalability, speed, and integration possibilities. In this comprehensive guide, we will navigate the process of operating on Solana with Helium, uncovering the advantages, setup procedures, ecosystem integration, best practices, and troubleshooting tips.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- A Helium-compatible wireless device (Hotspot)
- Access to the Solana blockchain
- Basic knowledge of the command line interface (CLI)

## Step 1: Setting Up Helium Nodes on Solana

### Install Required Software

Open your terminal and install the necessary software:

```bash
# Install Helium CLI
npm install -g helium-cli

# Install Solana CLI
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.8.4/install)"

Setting Up on Solana:

# Connect Helium node to Solana
helium-cli configure solana

+ Explore the benefits of Jupiter integration for Helium users engaging in token swaps.

d. Pyth Oracles:

# Install Pyth SDK
npm install -g pyth-sdk

# Retrieve HNT price information
pyth get-price -t "HNT/USD"

+ Pyth's oracles on Solana provide real-world data to Helium's on-chain programs.
+ Understand the role of Pyth in Helium's pricing mechanisms and data-driven operations.

e. Switchboard Oracle Network:

# Install Switchboard CLI
npm install -g switchboard-cli

# Retrieve device statistics using Switchboard
switchboard get-stats -d "device-address"

+ Switchboard facilitates a community-curated oracle network for Helium on Solana.
+ Delve into how Switchboard enhances device statistics incorporation into on-chain reward calculations.

f. Realms DAO Integration:

# Install Realms SDK
npm install -g realms-sdk

# Create a new DAO on Realms
realms create-dao -n "MyHeliumDAO" -m "Members"

+ Realms, a DAO platform on Solana, integrates Helium tokens and subnetwork delegation into its framework.
+ Explore the collaborative opportunities between Helium and Realms for decentralized governance.
